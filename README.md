This is an integrated system for processing binaural sound based on the azimuth 
angle. Additionally, a PC application was developed to visualise the azimuth angle captured by the microcontroller. 
A key feature that sets this project apart is its real-time capability to stream headings to the PC application while 
processing the binaural sound. Furthermore, this system includes self-calibration to compensate for any errors 
the sensor introduces.
